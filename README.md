# 🐍 202501_BackendWithPython

Repository created to gather my backend development learnings with **Python** during the **"Backend With Python"** course on the **Curso em Vídeo** platform.  
This project is also inspired by the **Web Programming I** subject in the **Big Data for Business** program at **FATEC Ipiranga**.

Here I share code, experiments, and small applications built throughout this journey. 🚀
